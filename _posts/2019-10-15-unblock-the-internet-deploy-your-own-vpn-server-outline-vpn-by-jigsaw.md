Outline is a Shadowsocks  based VPN server which means hard to monitor traffic. Actually Shadowsocks and VPN works differently. Both Shadowsocks  and VPN encrypt data. But Shadowsocks is more lightweight. Shadowsocks uses normal HTTPS traffic with multiple TCP connections which ISP or a Government cannot monitor.

Using Shadowsocks Nobody cannot block you. If ISP or Government Cooperation know your Outline server's IP, then they can. But who's gonna tell? There is no way to monitor Shadowsocks because all traffic going through HTTPS.
